# Integrated-Disease-Surveillance-Program-IDSP
In developing countries, there are outbreaks of contagious diseases and these outbreaks happen to do more harm because of the inability of municipal officers to predict the percentage of chances of the outbreak of the disease in the particular area.

We tried to solve this problem by predicting the percentage of chances of the outbreak of the disease in the particular area and reduce the effect by applying preventive measures beforehand.

Developed a web based application to predict the chances of the outbreak of a contagious disease using Logistic Regression.
